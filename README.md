# Notice:
This is not the original version of the modpack, but a modified one to fit my preferences. 

These modifications will make:
- Early create chapter rewards less infuriating
- Make mid-late game weaker
- Increase viability of less used skill paths in the skill tree
- Flies get blocked by torchmaster
- Foliaaths spawn in groups making them a harder fight
- Earth gauntlet buffs because it's worse than a bow
- Allow lvl 10 enchantments in blaze enchanter
- Remove Chalk and Ars Tomes from loot table
- Add some extra performence mods because I play on a potato
- Seagull no longer eat artifact food

I will not provide support of any kind and you shouldn't expect the original creators to do so too.

If you are one of the creators and don't like this repo. Notify me on discord.
